\title{Write a metFile object to disk in APSIM met format.}
\usage{
writeMetFile(fileName, met)
}
\arguments{
\item{fileName}{The file name to write to.}

\item{met}{The metFile object to write.}
}
\description{
Takes a completed metFile object (generated via \code{\link{prepareMet}} or
\code{\link{loadMet}}) and writes it to disk.
}
\details{
Note the file will not be written if the met object is missing required
information such as latitude, tav or amp. Note that while longitude is required
in \code{\link{prepareMet}}, it is not strictly required by APSIM and thus is
optional here. However, it is best practise to include it so it will remain
mandatory when building a met file via \code{\link{prepareMet}}.
